Description:

    This website is a work done for Fundamentals of Informatic Engineering.

    It will be formed by the following fields:

        - Index.html: A brief introduction about what will be in the webpage.

        - About.html: A presentation of myself with a cv, images and social network links.

        - Topic.html: The explanation of any chosen topic.

        - Net.html: Links to other people's webpages.

        - Degree: An explanation of what Computer Engineering is, with a list of all the subjects.

        - fundamentals.html: An indepth view of Fundamentals of Informatic Engineering.

        - Contact.html: A formulary with basic fields to contact me.

    It also has to have a css file common to every html.

Development:

    - Index.html:

        Firstly, I created the heading (menu), it consists of a "logo", a separator, and the different options    
        with an asociated icon.

        The borders were made with divs without content, using border-raius to round the borders.

        Every option in the menu consists of a "flexed" div to put the elements in a row, an image and an "a" with a "href" that references other webpages.

        I also added a footer with a gradient of the same color as the other elements of the website.

        The content of the index consists of a description of the website and a "information" image.

        I coloured the "T" logo in the heading orange to let the user know that he is in this page.

    - About.html

        In the content part, I added a title, an image with coloured and rounded borders, a "p" with a description of myself, the instagram logo as a clickable image that redirects the user to my instagram account, and my cv as a image.

        I also added the header that will be used in the entire website, colored the logo and the "About" text of the menu orange and changed the color of the "T" logo to blue instead of orange.

        I used the same footer as well.

    - Topic.html

        As the topic, I chose the one that we made the practical work I (3D printing on spaceships and satelites).

        I centered all the content, adding titles, subtitles and plain text formated by css.

        I got the information from the doc of practical work I.

        At the end of the page, I added a table to show the differences between normal and aerospacial 3D printers.

        I also used the same header with the page that we are on colored orange as well as the same footer.

    - Net.html

        Here, I used the same header but I removed the footer.

        I added a title like the one in topic.html.

        The user can acess the other pages clicking the image next to the name of the person who made that webpage.

    - Degree.html

        Same header and footer.

        I got the information from the UFV website.

        The text uses the same structure and style as the Topic site.

        The diferent subjects are shown as an unordered list.

        To go to the fundamentals.html, I created a "click here text" next to the subject in the lists.

    - Fundamentals.html

        I made this site separated from the other ones.

        I got all the information from the introduction slides of the subject in canvas.

        I removed the header but kept the footer.

        The styling and structure is the same as the degree and topic pages.

    - Contact.html

        This page consists of a simple form with the same header and no footer.

Conclusions:

    Overall, the idea of the design was the hardest part to make, I had to learn about divs and how they worked.
    I had to really understand "Flex" and how the divs are related to each other to position the different 
    elements of the website.

    Once the design part was done, everything whent smoothly. I had no trouble with html.
